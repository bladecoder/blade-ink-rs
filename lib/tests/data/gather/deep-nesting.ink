            *   "Very well, you sea-dogs. Here's a tale..."
                * *     "It was a dark and stormy night..."
                        * * *   "...and the crew were restless..."
                                * * * *  "... and they said to their Captain..."
                                        * * * * *       "...Tell us a tale Captain!"
            *   "No, it's past your bed-time."
