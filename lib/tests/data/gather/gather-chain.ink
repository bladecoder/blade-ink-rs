        I ran through the forest, the dogs snapping at my heels.
            *   I checked the jewels[] were still in my pocket, and the feel of them brought a spring to my step. <>
            *  I did not pause for breath[] but kept on running. <>
            *   I cheered with joy. <>
        -   The road could not be much further! Mackie would have the engine running, and then I'd be safe.
            *   I reached the road and looked about[]. And would you believe it?
            *   I should interrupt to say Mackie is normally very reliable[]. He's never once let me down. Or rather, never once, previously to that night.
        -   The road was empty. Mackie was nowhere to be seen.
