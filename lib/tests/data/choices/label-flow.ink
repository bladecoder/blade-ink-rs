=== meet_guard ===
        The guard frowns at you.
        *   (greet) [Greet him]
            'Greetings.'
        *   (get_out) 'Get out of my way[.'],' you tell the guard.
        -   'Hmm,' replies the guard.
        *   {greet}     'Having a nice day?'
        *   'Hmm?'[] you reply.        
        *   {get_out} [Shove him aside]
            You shove him sharply. He stares in reply, and draws his sword!

        -   'Mff,' the guard replies, and then offers you a paper bag. 'Toffee?'
